I defended [my bachelor thesis][my-bachelor-thesis] on Wednesday, 21 June 2016 and after some revisions, submitted my final thesis the day after. It is safe to assume that I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree now (I am an engineer!).

Many thanks to:

* my thesis advisor, Mas [Zuher Syihab][zuher-syihab],
* my thesis examiner, Mas [Amega Yasutra][amega-yasutra],
* and Mas [Sutopo][sutopo] who was also present and gave plenty of inputs into my thesis discussion.

I may have taken five years to graduate, but I must say I barely regret it. Due to my having to take (and *retake*) some credits, I used the chance to hone my skills and revisit some fundamental concepts, which I almost took for granted.

Most importantly, most thanks are given to my mom who always understands my nerdy need and was willing to give me some *rather high-end* computer.
