I was trying to reproduce a scenario on how to get rid of a secondary OS with an existing primary OS (Windows 7) before actually installing a secondary OS (I've been wanting to install [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) for a while now). For this, I chose Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I had been using Ubuntu on [VirtualBox][] inside the primary Windows 7 for quite sometime, so I was confident I could work this out. Heck, I had even successfully installed Ubuntu on my laptop three years before.

#### Computer condition
1. Has two drives installed. One SSD (`/dev/sdb`) and one HDD (`/dev/sda`). Windows 7 as the primary OS was installed in the SSD.
    The original partition scheme as given by `fdisk -l` is as follows:
    
    * `/dev/sda`
    
        | Device | Start | End | Sectors | Size | Type |
        |:-------|:------|:----|:--------|:-----|:-----|
        | /dev/sda1 | 34 | 262177 | 262144 | 128M |  Microsoft reserved |
        | /dev/sda2 | 264192 | 7793481727 | 7793217536 | 3,6T | Microsoft basic data |

        <br>
    * `/dev/sdb`
    
        | Device | Start | End | Sectors | Size | Type |
	|:-------|:------|:----|:--------|:-----|:-----|
        | /dev/sdb1 | 2048 | 206847 | 204800 | 100M | Microsoft basic data |
        | /dev/sdb2 | 206848 | 250058751 | 249851904 | 119,1G | Microsoft basic data |
2. BIOS was set to boot from SSD.
3. The motherboard is GIGABYTE's [GA-H97-D3H][] which already supports [UEFI][]. I still did not actually know what BIOS/UEFI was. Did a quick Google search, and figured since I had Windows 7 installed and it did not support UEFI. I should just forget about the UEFI stuff for the time being.

Ubuntu is one of those user-friendly linux distributions and thus considered [one of the best choices for beginners][]. With a GUI interface when installation, one may just click Next (then Next then Next) and wait for its complete installation. My confidence still worked just fine until I arrived at this,

Only then did I remember that I actually had two drives! Fearing that I would mess up, I went for option *Something else* just to be safe. The next window would then be something similar to this,

![Installation type (Managing partition)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pxWk2cy-L_8/UjDam7FVitI/AAAAAAAABhY/rqNPjx0PVFg/s1600/ubuntu6.png)

***Fig. 2** - Image taken from [everydaylinuxuser.com](http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2013/09/install-ubuntu-linux-alongside-windows.html). Just a sketch. The actual windows showed up in my case had `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb` in it*

Now this is the part where I messed up.

I had watched [a YouTube video tutorial on installing Arch Linux][]. It was said that it was neater to just declare two partitions for `swap` and `/`. I should not worry about the specifics too much, i.e. let Ubuntu further allocate how to put `/boot`, `/usr`, `/home` directories. I then proceed by changing the partition scheme for `/dev/sda` into the following,

| Device | Start | End | Sectors | Size | Type |
|:-------|:------|:----|:--------|:-----|:-----|
| /dev/sda1 | 34 | 262177 | 262144 | 128M |  Microsoft reserved |
| /dev/sda2 | 264192 | 7793481727 | 7793217536 | 3,6T | Microsoft basic data |
| /dev/sda3 | 7793481728 | 7797481471 | 3999744 | 1,9G | Linux swap |
| /dev/sda4 | 7797481472 | 7813482495 | 16001024 | 7,6G | Linux filesystem |

with `/dev/sda3` being the `swap` partition and `/dev/sda4` being the `/` partition.

Now, if you notice *Fig. 2*, you can see that Ubuntu also asks us to specify *Device for boot loader installation*. I guessed this referred to [GRUB]. This was the part where it got messy to the point that I had to resort to re-installing Ubuntu for four times. I put the list of my failed attempts as follows


- Iteration 0 (Installed `GRUB` on `/dev/sdb`)
  
    I did a quick Google search and found that `GRUB` should be installed on the disk (not on a partition). This means on a `/dev/sdX`, rather than `/dev/sdXY`. I thought that since my BIOS booted from SSD (`/dev/sdb`), it would make sense to install the boot loader on `/dev/sdb`.

    Everything seemed good. Restarted the machine. `GRUB` showed up, but there was no Windows 7 option. I just thought it must have been *that regular issue* in which I should just resort to [Boot-Repair][]'s automatic repair and `GRUB` would finally display Windows 7.

    I instead encountered this problem.

    > GPT detected. Please create a BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag). This can be performed via tools such as Gparted. Then try again.

    This problem seemed to present itself to other people in various ways (try googling by quoting the words *"GPT detected. Please create a..."*).
    

- Iteration 1 (Installed `GRUB` ***on a partition*** in `/dev/sda`)


- Iteration 2
