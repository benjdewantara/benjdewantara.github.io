My aim when setting up this blog (perhaps also when setting up [my first Wordpress blog ever](http://benjdewantara.wordpress.com)) is just for the fun of hacking the CMS itself. I just have never been much of a writer who actually blogs myself. That pretty much will explain my later intention on migrating my Wordpress posts to ![this Jekyll site]({{ site.url }}).

But why now? Well, since I decided to blog more seriously on Wordpress, I have been looking for [a Wordpress theme that actually is a blog](https://wordpress.org/themes/search/blog), without unnecessary slider, footer, header, menu bar, widgets and other feature. I ended up with my current ![Bosco theme](https://boscodemo.wordpress.com) that is quite beautiful.

I may stick a little bit longer with Wordpress, but I find myself more comfortable with text interface rather than visual interface when writing a post.
