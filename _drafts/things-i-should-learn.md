I have been telling myself I should learn all sort of stuff since my college days. Shortly after I officially had all the time in this world ([after I got my thesis done][thesis-done]), I could not bring myself to do even one thing. The only thing I have managed to learn is just [how to use emacs][daniel-gopar-playlist]--watched the first three of his tutorial videos.

Below are things I have been wanting to learn:

- Computer Science
- Mathematics
- Economics
